"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ch!pz!"
"Do it! Are you ready?"
Rockstar (come on, 1, 2, 3, hey)

We're gonna make our way to Hollywood
A star on Sunset B is understood
We put our makeup on and hit the stage
We're gonna blow you away

'Cause when the music starts
And all the lights are on
We're gonna play all night long

Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna play the guitar
Gonna rock it for you, oh
Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna drive a fast car
'Cause that's what they do

I wanna be a star, whoa, oh
I wanna be a rockstar

We put the spandex on and fix the hair
The girls are screaming, they are everywhere
Turn on the radio, they play our song
From London to LA, this can't be wrong

'Cause when the music starts
And all the lights are on
We're gonna play all night long

Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna play the guitar
Gonna rock it for you, oh
Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna drive a fast car
'Cause that's what they do

Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna play the guitar
Gonna rock it for you, oh
Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna drive a fast car
'Cause that's what they do

I wanna be a star, rockstar
"Come on, put your hands together!"
Rockstar, rockstar (here we go)
Rockstar (come on, sing it)
Rockstar

Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna play the guitar
Gonna rock it for you, oh
Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna drive a fast car
'Cause that's what they do

Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna play the guitar
Gonna rock it for you, oh
Rockstar, wanna be a rockstar
Wanna drive a fast car
'Cause that's what they do

I wanna be a star
