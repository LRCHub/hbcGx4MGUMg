Gold teeth sittin' on the dash
She a rockstar
Make your favorite singer
wanna rap　Baby, la, la
"Lisa, can you
teach me Japanese?"
I said "Hai, Hai"
That's my life, life
Baby, I'm a rockstar
Been on a mission, boy
They call me catch-and-kill
I'm stealin' diamonds
Make them chase me
for the thrill
Been MIA, BKK so pretty
Every city that I go is my city
Gold teeth sittin' on the dash
She a rockstar
Make your favorite singer
wanna rap　Baby, la, la
"Lisa, can you
teach me Japanese?"
I said "Hai, Hai"
That's my life, life
Baby, I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar
It's not hype, hype
Baby, make you rock-hard
Make a wish, babe
What you wanna do?
Dippin' outta big cities
Like a ponzu
It's a fast life
It's an attitude
Put it on the calеndar
And tell me
when to comе through
Yes, yes, I can spend it
Yes, yes, no pretendin'
Tight dress, LV sent it
Oh shit, Lisa reppin'
Been on a mission, boy
They call me catch-and-kill
I'm stealin' diamonds
Make them chase me
for the thrill
Been MIA, BKK so pretty
Every city that I go is my city
Gold teeth sittin' on the dash
She a rockstar
Make your favorite singer
wanna rap　Baby, la, la
"Lisa, can you
teach me Japanese?"
I said "Hai, Hai"
That's my life, life
Baby, I'm a rockstar
Gold teeth sittin' on the dash
She a rockstar
Make your favorite singer
wanna rap　Baby, la, la
"Lisa, can you
teach me Japanese?"
I said "Hai, Hai"
That's my life, life
Baby, I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar
It's not hype, hype
Baby, make you rock-hard
I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar
It's not hype, hype
Baby, make you rock-hard
Ooh, and the music goin'
Ooh, and the girls are posin'
Ooh, don't it get you in a mood?
It's not hype, hype
Baby, I'm a rockstar
